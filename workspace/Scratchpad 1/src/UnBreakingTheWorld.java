//What's the purpose of a class?
	//To represent a real-world or business-world object
		//We often build a class using metaphor
	//Data type is any object - and he means any.
		//Includes all value and reference types.
	//Classes are just data types.


	//Class definitions are shared to all instances.
	//Instances are unique in nature.
	//Instances can see static, but static CANNOT set instances.
